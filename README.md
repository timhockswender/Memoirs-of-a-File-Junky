1.	The Origin Story!
I have a Ph. D. In organic chemistry from 1973 and started a career in industry, focusing on applications of polymer science. The use of personal computers and the internet were in the future but applications of computing in science and in the R&D work environment were useful and supported. I had learned Fortran IV a few years earlier and had used it in my thesis work but didn’t realize the problem that this generated. I had unwittingly stared on the path to embodiment of the phrase “When you get a new hammer, every problem looks like a nail”.
